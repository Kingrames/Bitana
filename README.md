# Bitana
This is the collectible chess piece game known as Bitana.

In this early pre-alpha state, I am working on getting a small selection of pieces available to use, along with a very minimal amount of gameplay, and a main menu that can later add functionality for opening packs, forming pre-arranged formations (to make gameplay easier to set up), and starting a game either against another player or against a computer.
